        <h1>Why Use a ToDo List?</h1>
        <p>
            We all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we don't know how we're going to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks that we must do from day to day. Sometimes we have so many balls in the air, that we may even lose track of some loose ends and forget to do important things. When we get too busy, we end up feeling like we are barely able to keep our heads above water.One of the most important reasons for keeping a to-do list is the organization. Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded.Feeling forgetful? Nobody is capable of remembering everything at all times. To-do lists are a useful external memory aid that give you permission to forget.Every time you look at a list, it reinforces the information in your short-term memory, making it much less likely that you will forget an appointment or commitment.So, start making your to-do lists today. You'll soon be less stressed, more organized and find yourself with more time in the day than you ever realized you had!
